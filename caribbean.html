	<p>Ever listen to music that made you want to move? Felt the rhythm and tapped your feet or fingers? Well, that's certainly the case with many people in the Caribbean! In this lesson, we'll explore the styles, moves, and history of <b>Caribbean Dance</b>.<br>
		
	<p><b>History of Dance in the Caribbean</b><br>Sometimes, you want to get up and dance. Music compels your body to move. Think of salsa, mambo, and calypso. They're all part of Caribbean dance. Have you heard music from places like Cuba, Trinidad, or the Dominican Republic? These Caribbean islands have strong cultures of music and dance.</p>

	<p>Before we get to dancing, let's define Caribbean geography. It's a group of more than 7,000 islands in the Caribbean Sea scattered southeast of Gulf of Mexico, east of Central America, and north of South America. The Caribbean includes Cuba, Hispaniola (the countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Trinidad and Tobago, among others.</p>

	<p>Caribbean dance evolved from complex influences, including slavery and colonialism. Enslaved Africans, brought to the islands to work on vast plantations, carried customs and drumming traditions with them. Using available materials, they crafted instruments and kept elements of their cultures alive. French and Spanish colonists came with their music and dance customs. Caribbean dance also adopted elements of dances from ceremonies of indigenous cultures like the Taino people, who lived on several islands including Cuba and Jamaica.</p>

	<p>Over time, customs blended and became new music and dance. Regardless of style, there's a familiar pattern in historical development: Afro-Caribbean people maintain and build on dance customs through time. Although initially looked down upon by those in the upper classes (regarded the expressiveness and body moves salacious and vulgar), styles persisted and evolved. They grew in popularity first in local neighborhoods and then found their way to broader appeal.

	<b>Basic Characteristics of Caribbean Dance</b>
	<p>Words used to describe Caribbean dance include fluid, sensual, and rhythmic. Many dance styles are social, often experienced at Carnival or other celebrations. Some involve partners. Many styles have numerous variations: some up-tempo, others slower and sensuous.</p>

	<p>These dances are often polyrhythmic, which means dancers move to multiple competing rhythms in the music. The dances are sometimes polycentric, with different parts of the body moving at the same time, or they reflect elements of body isolation, where the dance at some point focuses on one body part. In many, there's an emphasis on hip rolling and hip swinging, which may have come from African customs (possibly from dance ceremonies in places like the Congo, Angola, and the former Zaire). Whining is a word sometimes used to describe the thrusting or rotating of the pelvis and rolling of the waist that's found in many Caribbean dances. In some dances, the emphasis is on the waist without much foot movement while others have intricate steps and complicated interaction between dancers. Now let's look at three styles in more detail.</p>
	<p><b>Mambo, Merengue, and Calypso</b><br>
		Mambo is a type of dance from Cuba that evolved through a mix of African, Cuban and Haitian customs. Developing from earlier dance forms like rumba, it's a partner dance with high energy. It's danced to a 4/4 beat with specific foot movement, while always maintaining fluid motion. As the feet move, the dancers glide backward and forward with exaggerated hip movement. Today, mambo has evolved into a more contemporary style of dance called salsa.

	<p>Merengue comes from the Dominican Republic where it evolved from a mix of African dance and French minuet. Also a couples' dance, it begins with partners holding each other and taking small steps to the side. The man makes a series of steps called the chase. He keeps his right leg stiff and drags it to meet the left. It's a central move in merengue, with a lot of folklore about how it originated. In 2/4 time, dancers follow a two-step beat with small but sometimes complex turns from one of the partners.</p>
